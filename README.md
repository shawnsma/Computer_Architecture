# Computer Architecture

This repository contains a collection of projects related to computer architecture, focusing on how computer hardware executes software.

## Overview

These projects explore various aspects of computer architecture, including:

1. **Instruction Sets**  
2. **Assembly Language Programming**  
3. **Basic Digital Logic Design**  
4. **Processor Design**  
5. **Memory System Design**  
6. **Input/Output**  

## Projects

1. **Cache Simulator (`cachesim.java`)**  
   A Java program that simulates cache behavior based on various parameters such as cache size, associativity, and block size.

2. **Plus/Minus Calculator (`plusminus.c` & `plusminus.s`)**  
   C and assembly programs that read player statistics from a file, calculate plus/minus scores, and sort the results.

3. **Recursive Function (`recurse.c` & `recurse.s`)**  
   C and assembly programs demonstrating a recursive function implementation.

4. **Tribonacci Sequence (`tribonacci.c` & `tribonacci.s`)**  
   C and assembly programs that generate and print the Tribonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.

5. **Processor Simulation (`cpu.circ`)**  
   A Logisim simulation of the Duke 250/16, a 16-bit, single-cycle MIPS-like processor, designed to implement a functioning RISC architecture that executes a provided instruction set and adheres to defined memory and clocking requirements.
